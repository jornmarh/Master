All relaxed correctly bellow 1E-2, don't know what happend to strD. eigenval does show a very small gap in up, down and total, but not in dos. the eigenval file show large differences in band nr where we transistion from 1 to 0 occ. Also defect states in both channels. No gap with scan. The difference in eigenval is to large in B to calculate the gap with my script. Small gap in C, both from eigenvalues and DOS. With PBE, no defect states in down, With scan we still find a gap in down, but now with defect states, hence the dos does not show any gap in any channels. strE ugly, many defect stats, no gap what so ever.

All relaxed bellow 1E-2. No gap due to defect states in eigenval, not gap in dos as well. removing these states yield a small gap of 0.013 eV in total. Scan finds a small gap in down, but not total, also defects here. strB have a small gap in down, in both eigenval and dos, maybe plot this with more nedos, with PBE no defect states in down. SCAN finds exactly opposite, but only from eigenval and not DOS. C no gap. PBE finds a small gap in up from eigenval, not in dos. No gap with scan. In strE, we find a very small gap in up, down and total from eigenvalues with PBE, no gap in any channels from DOS, defect states in both spins. SCAN only finds a very small gap in up.

 In conclusion for this structure, we find a large difference in band where we transistion from 1 to 0 occ, defect states in every structure and permutation. Neglecting the defects, we find small total gaps in every structure, around 0.01 eV. The DOS only show 0 occ for spin down for very few structures.
