abstract = {We present a new algorithm to generate Special Quasirandom Structures (SQS), i.e., best periodic supercell approximations to the true disordered state for a given number of atoms per supercell. The method is based on a Monte Carlo simulated annealing loop with an objective function that seeks to perfectly match the maximum number of correlation functions (as opposed to merely minimizing the distance between the SQS correlation and the disordered state correlations for a pre-specified set of correlations). The proposed method optimizes the shape of the supercell jointly with the occupation of the atomic sites, thus ensuring that the configurational space searched is exhaustive and not biased by a pre-specified supercell shape. The method has been implemented in the “mcsqs” code of the Alloy Theoretic Automated Toolkit (ATAT) in the most general framework of multicomponent multisublattice systems and in a way that minimizes the amount of input information the user needs to specify and that allows for efficient parallelization.}

ABSTRACT={Similar to the importance of XRD in experiments, ab initio calculations, as a powerful tool, have been applied to predict the new potential materials and investigate the intrinsic properties of materials in theory. As a typical solid-solution material, the large degree of uncertainty of high-entropy alloys (HEAs) results in the difficulty of ab initio calculations application to HEAs. The present review focuses on the available ab initio based solid-solution models (virtual lattice approximation, coherent potential approximation, special quasirandom structure, similar local atomic environment, maximum-entropy method, and hybrid Monte Carlo/molecular dynamics) and their applications and limits in single phase HEAs.}

For the HEAs composed of the atoms with similar atomic radius and electronic configuration, such as FeCoNiCr combined with Cu or V, the LCs obtained by SQS and VCA methods are close to each other. When combined with atoms with quite different atomic radius and electronic configuration, such as Nb, Ge or Ti, there is obvious lattice distortion in the SQS supercell, and the LCs of VCA models are quite different from that of SQS models. The SQS method can be replaced by VCA when estimating LCs of HEAs composed of atoms with similar properties, which is helpful to increase computation efficiency.}

According to the results, the crystal structure and magnetic properties calculated from the SQS structure fit well with those of the HEAs. It is found that, the addition of Mn leads to significant enhancement in saturated magnetization (BS) and Curie temperature (TC) of the FeCoNiSi0.2M0.2 HEA compared to Cr, which is caused by the changes of electron-spin that lead to ferromagnetism of Mn, and such phenomenon may have close correlation with the ferromagnetic coupling between Mn and FeCoNi matrix. This work provides a novel insight for the compositional design of ferromagnetic HEAs with excellent magnetic properties.}

All the calculations were performed using full-potential linearized augmented plane wave plus local orbitals (FP-L/APW+lo) method within the frame work of density functional theory (DFT). The DFT functionals, Wu–Cohen generalized gradient approximation (WC-GGA), Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof GGA (PBE–GGA) and modified Becke–Johnson GGA (mBJ–GGA) were applied to calculate the exchange–correlation energy and band gap energies. In structural optimization, the predicted results of lattice constant and bulk modulus have shown a non-linear behavior with the selected doping concentrations. From the study of band structures, it has been noticed that the compounds and their alloys under study has metallic behavior in RS phase except at x=0 and 0.25 concentrations (indirect band gaps), whereas semiconducting behavior is obvious in ZB phase with increasing doping order (direct band gaps). The total and partial densities of states (TDOS and PDOS) have been examined to deeply study the electronic properties. Finally, by incorporating the basic optical properties, we discussed the dielectric function, refractive index, optical reflectivity, the absorption coefficient and optical conductivity in terms of incident photon energy up to 20eV.}

Using both equimolar and non-equimolar quinary CoCuFeNiPd HEAs with SRO as an example, we calculate ground state energy, lattice constant, mass density and elastic moduli, and compare them with those obtained from the special quasi-random structure (SQS) method. The calculated properties are in good agreement with those obtained by SQS. Importantly, the computational cost of the SSOS method for achieving the same accuracy is only a small fraction of the computational cost of the SQS method. We further show that the application of machine learning methods can further reduce the computational cost of the SSOS method and maintain the same level of accuracy, making it especially suitable for high-throughput calculations of HEAs with SRO.}

abstract="Alloys have evolved from simple to complex compositions depending on the ability of mankind to develop the materials. The resulting improved functions and performances of alloys enable advancements in civilizations. In the last century, significant evolution and progress have led to the invention of special alloys, such as stainless steels, high-speed steels, and superalloys. Although alloys composed of multiple elements have higher mixing entropy than pure metals, the improved properties are mostly due to mixing enthalpy that allows the addition of suitable alloying elements to increase the strength and improve physical and/or chemical properties. Since the turn of the century, more complex compositions with higher mixing entropies have been introduced. Such complex compositions do not necessarily guarantee a complex structure and microstructure, or the accompanied brittleness. Conversely, significantly higher mixing entropy from complex compositions could simplify the structure and microstructure and impart attractive properties to the alloys. Jien-Wei Yeh and Brian Cantor independently announced the feasibility of high-entropy alloys and equi-atomic multicomponent alloys in reports published in 2004. This breakthrough in alloying concepts has accelerated research on these new materials throughout the world over the last decade.",

abstract="Physical metallurgy is a branch of materials science, especially focusing on the relationship between composition, processing, crystal structure and microstructure, and physical and mechanical properties. Because all properties are the manifestation of compositions, structure and microstructure, thermodynamics, kinetics, and plastic deformation, factors as encountered in processing control become very important to control phase transformation and microstructure and thus properties of alloys. All the underlying principles have been well built and physical metallurgy approaches mature. However, traditional physical metallurgy is based on the observations on conventional alloys. As composition is the most basic and original factor to determine the bonding, structure, microstructure, and thus properties to a certain extent, physical metallurgy principles might be different and need to be modified for HEAs which have entirely different compositions from conventional alloys. The most distinguished effects in HEAs are high-entropy, severe lattice distortion, sluggish diffusion, and cocktail effects. This chapter will present and discuss the corresponding subjects of physical metallurgy based on these effects.",

abstract="Special quasi-random structures (SQSs) are an important tool in modeling disordered alloys with atomic resolution. This chapter first presents the framework and the tools available to generate SQS for high-entropy alloys (HEAs). Examples of SQS in 4- and 5-component equiatomic alloys with face-centered cubic (FCC), hexagonal close-packed (HCP), and body-centered cubic (BCC) crystal structures, which are central to HEAs, are provided with different SQS cell sizes. Using SQS, the phase stability of known single-phase HEAs is examined, and the vibrational, electronic, and mechanical properties are predicted. Finally, the chapter compares the strength and limitations of SQS with hybrid Monte Carlo/molecular dynamics (MC/MD) simulations and coherent potential approximation (CPA) as introduced in prior chapters. First-principles calculations on selected single-phase HEAs show that the vibrational entropy of mixing is small, and the electronic entropy of mixing is truly negligible. Excellent agreement in the electronic density of states of HEAs was observed using SQS versus MC/MD. The accuracy of these SQS models is sensitive to the size of the cell, and larger cells produce more reliable results.",

By including awarded grants, patents, and clinical trials alongside publication and Altmetric attention data, Dimensions goes beyond the standard publication-citation ecosystem to give the user a much greater sense of context of a piece of research. All entities in the graph may be linked to all other entities. Thus, a patent may be linked to a grant, if an appropriate reference is made. Books, book chapters, and conference proceedings are included in the publication index. All entities are treated as first-class objects and are mapped to a database of research institutions and a standard set of research classifications via machine-learning techniques. This article gives an overview of the methodology of construction of the Dimensions dataset and user interface.},

abstract  ="The derivative discontinuity is a key concept in electronic structure theory in general and density functional theory in particular. The electronic energy of a quantum system exhibits derivative discontinuities with respect to different degrees of freedom that are a consequence of the integer nature of electrons. The classical understanding refers to the derivative discontinuity of the total energy as a function of the total number of electrons (N){,} but it can also manifest at constant N. Examples are shown in models including several hydrogen systems with varying numbers of electrons or nuclear charge (Z){,} as well as the 1-dimensional Hubbard model (1DHM). Two sides of the problem are investigated: first{,} the failure of currently used approximate exchange–correlation functionals in DFT and{,} second{,} the importance of the derivative discontinuity in the exact electronic structure of molecules{,} as revealed by full configuration interaction (FCI). Currently{,} all approximate functionals{,} including hybrids{,} miss the derivative discontinuity{,} leading to basic errors that can be seen in many ways: from the complete failure to give the total energy of H2 and H2+{,} to the missing gap in Mott insulators such as stretched H2 and the thermodynamic limit of the 1DHM{,} or a qualitatively incorrect density in the HZ molecule with two electrons and incorrect electron transfer processes. Description of the exact particle behaviour of electrons is emphasised{,} which is key to many important physical processes in real systems{,} especially those involving electron transfer{,} and offers a challenge for the development of new exchange–correlation functionals."}

abstract = {Magnetic materials with excellent performances are desired for functional applications. Based on the high-entropy effect, a system of CoFeMnNiX (X = Al, Cr, Ga, and Sn) magnetic alloys are designed and investigated. The dramatic change in phase structures from face-centered-cubic (FCC) to ordered body-centered-cubic (BCC) phases, caused by adding Al, Ga, and Sn in CoFeMnNiX alloys, originates from the potent short-range chemical order in the liquid state predicted by ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. This phase transition leads to the significant enhancement of the saturation magnetization (Ms), e.g., the CoFeMnNiAl alloy has Ms of 147.86 Am2/kg. First-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the electronic and magnetic structures reveal that the anti-ferromagnetism of Mn atoms in CoFeMnNi is suppressed especially in the CoFeMnNiAl HEA because Al changes the Fermi level and itinerant electron-spin coupling that lead to ferromagnetism.}

X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) collectively show the formation of a single high-entropy silicide phase. This high-entropy (Mo0.2Nb0.2Ta0.2Ti0.2W0.2)Si2 possesses a hexagonal C40 crystal structure with ABC stacking sequence and a space group of P6222. This discovery expands the known families of high-entropy materials from metals, oxides, borides, carbides, and nitrides to a silicide, for the first time to our knowledge, as well as demonstrating that a new, non-cubic, crystal structure (with lower symmetry) can be made into high-entropy phase. This (Mo0.2Nb0.2Ta0.2Ti0.2W0.2)Si2 exhibits high nanohardness of 16.7 ± 1.9 GPa and Vickers hardness of 11.6 ± 0.5 GPa. Moreover, it has a low thermal conductivity of 6.9 ± 1.1 W m−1 K−1, which is approximately one order of magnitude lower than that of the widely-used tetragonal MoSi2 and ∼1/3 of those reported values for the hexagonal NbSi2 and TaSi2 with the same crystal structure.}

Standard molar entropies of (45.57 ± 0.50)J · K−1· mol−1and (68.31 ± 0.71)J · K · mol−1at T= 298.15 K for FeSi and α- FeSi2, respectively, have been found. In an optimization procedure, the standard molar enthalpies of formation ΔfHmowere calculated using our measured data and data calculated from (iron + silicon) melts. The values obtained are: for FeSi, ΔfHmo(298.15 K) =−73.89kJ · mol−1and for α- FeSi2, ΔfHmo(298.15 K) =−78.62kJ · mol−1.}
