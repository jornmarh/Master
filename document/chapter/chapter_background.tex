\section{Overview of sold-state physics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Crystal structure
    \item Reciprocal lattice + Brilluin zone
    \item Chemical bonding + orbitals + energy bands
    \item Band gap + DOS ++

\section{3d Silicides}
In this project, we will build high-entropy silicides based on several promising 3d silicides, in terms of particularly the band gap. The silicides are $CrSi_2$, $MnSi_{1.75}$, $FeSi_2$ and $Fe_2Si$. A summary of their most relevant properties for this project is listed in table .., and their corresponding crystal structure is displayed in figure ..
