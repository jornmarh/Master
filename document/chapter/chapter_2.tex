\chapter{High-Entropy alloys}
\label{sec:HEA}

High-Entropy Alloys have become a quickly emerging field in materials science in part to the increased flexibility and possibilities in discovering new materials with unique properties. Since the original discovery in 2004, as of 2015 there have been over 1000 published journal articles on high-entropy alloys. In the following section we introduce the fundamentals and some of the applications of high-entropy alloys, this section will be based on the fantastic description of HEAs in "High-Entropy Alloys - Fundamentals and Application", in particular chapters 1,2,3 and 7 \cite{hea2016_ch1}, \cite{hea2016_ch2}, \cite{hea2016_ch3}, \cite{hea2016_ch7} and references therein.

\section{Fundamentals} 
A high entropy alloy can be compared to a smoothie. In a smoothie one can produce unique combinations of flavors and nutritional values based on both the properties of the distinct fruits and vegetables, and their interplay in the mixture. In materials science, this exact procedure can be applied to generate a large range of materials with tunable properties depending on the intended application. In respect to HEA's, examples are increased strength, ductility, corrosive resistance or lowered thermal conductivity. 
Moving on from the rather banal fruit analogy, a high-entropy alloy can be defines  typically falls under the two conditions.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The material consist of at least 5 distinct elements, where each element contribute between 5-35$\%$ of the composition
    \item The total configurational entropy is greater than 1.5R, where R is the gas constant. 
\end{enumerate}
The latter is an especial case for high-entropy alloys. The ideal configurational entropy of random N-component solid-solution is given in eq \ref{Sconfig}
\begin{equation}
\Delta S_{\text{config}} = -R \sum_{i=1}^{N}X_i\ln X_i, \label{Sconfig}
\end{equation}
 it's clear that $\Delta S_{\text{config}}$ increase with a higher number of constituents in the mix. For instance, the ideal configurational entropy of a binary alloy is $0.69R$, while a 5-component alloy is $1.61R$. If we neglect other factors that influence the formation of solid solutions (will be covered later), from Gibbs free energy in eq \ref{gibbs}
\begin{equation}
\Delta G_{\text{mix}} = \Delta H_{\text{mix}} - T\Delta S_{\text{mix}}, \label{gibbs}
\end{equation} 
the two primary factors in formation of solid solution is the mixing enthalpy, which is the driving force to form compounds, and the mixing entropy which is the driving force to form random solid solutions. At elevated temperatures especially, the energy associated to the entropy of the system becomes comparative to the mixing enthalpy and can impact the overall equation. In summary, the overall concept of high-entropy alloys is that through alloying a greater number of elements, the gain in configurational entropy of the system prohibit the formation of intermetallic compounds in favor of a random solid solution. The random term simply relate to the various components occupying lattice positions based on probability. In fact, a narrower definition of high-entropy alloys would be structures with a single-phase disordered solid solution. The two "definitions" given previously can be considered as guidelines for the latter.
 
All though the mixing entropy mentioned above plays a central role in the formation, there are other factors to consider, and some that may oppose the formation of a single disordered phase. One of these is the atomic size effect which is related to the differences in atomic size, between the various elements in the alloy, this quantity is denoted $\delta$. Y. Zhang et al. in 2008 illustrated the relationship between $\Delta H_\text{mix}$ and $\delta$. When $\delta$ is very small, ie similar atomic sizes. The elements have an equal probability to occupy lattice sites to form solid solutions, but the mixing enthalpy is not negative enough to promote formation of solid solution. Increasing $\delta$ does result in greater $\Delta H_\text{mix}$, but leads to a higher degree of ordering. \textbf{Include figure?}To summarize the illustration, the formation of solid solution high-entropy alloys occur in a narrow range of $\delta$ value that satisfy both the enthalpy of mixing and the disordered state. Recently, Yang and Zhang proposed the parameter $\Omega$ to evaluate the stability of high-entropy alloys. The quantity is a product of the melting temperature $T_m$, mixing entropy and mixing enthalpy in the following manner

\begin{equation}
\Omega = \frac{T_\text{m} \delta S_\text{mix}}{|\Delta H_\text{mix}|}.
\end{equation}

They managed to obtain a qualitative condition for formation of the single disordered solid solution at $\Omega \geq 1.1$ and $\delta \leq 6.6\%$. While compounds such as intermetallics form for greater values of $\delta$ and lesser values of $\Omega$. Similarly, replacing the atomic size effect constant for the number of elements result in an equivalent condition. The results are summarized in figure \ref{Omega}

An important quantity in terms of characterizing high-entropy alloys is the total number of electrons VEC. The valence electron concentration of a material is strongly related to the crystal structure of the material. For example, $Co_3V$, originally a hexagonal structure can be transformed into a tetragonal or cubic structure by either increasing the VEC from alloying with Ni, or reduction with Fe respectfully. Derived from the work of Guo et al. on the phase stability of a $Al_xCrCuFeNi_2$ HEA, the VEC can be directly related to the crystal structure of high-entropy alloys. A lower VEC stabilize the BCC phase, while higher values stabilize FCC. In between is a mixture of the two. Specifically values greater than 8.0 stabilize FCC, and values bellow 6.87 favor BCC. However, these boundaries is not rigid when including elements outside of transition metals, exceptions has also been found for high-entropy alloys containing $Mn$. All though a heavy majority of reported high-entropy alloys that form solid solutions have been found to adopt simple cubic structures such as FCC and BCC. Recent studies have observed HEA's in orthorombic structures like $Ti_{35}Zr_{27.5}Hf_{27.5}Ta_5Nb_5$ and hcp structures, for example $CoFeNiTi$.

\section{Core effects and properties}
Next, we will summarize the discussion above into four core effects of high entropy alloys coupled with the unique properties observed in HEAs. The first of these is called the "high-entropy effect", as explained in the previous section the configurational entropy of HEAs is much greater than in traditional solids or even binary alloys, this quantity is central to stabilize the disordered phase ahead of intermetalic or strongly ordered structures. Thus this effect can result in enhanced strength and ductility. From considerations of Gibbs free energy (Eq. 1), we see that this effect is most prominent at elevated temperatures.

The second effect is the "severe lattice distortion effect" that arises from the fact that every element in a high-entropy structure is surrounded by non-homogeneous elements, thus leading to severe lattice strain and stress. The overall lattice distortion is additionally attributed to the differences in atomic size, bonding energies and crystal structure tendencies between the components. Therefore the total lattice distortion observed in HEA's are significantly greater than that of conventional alloys. This effect mostly affect the strength and conductivity of the material, such that a higher degree of distortion yields greater strength and greatly reduces the electronic and thermal conductivity due to increased electron and phonon scattering. An upside to this is that the scattering and following properties become less temperature dependent given that it originates from the lattice rather than thermal vibrations.

The two remaining effects, "sluggish diffusion" and "cocktail effect" can be summarized swiftly. The first is a direct consequence of the multi-component layout of high-entropy alloys that result in slowed diffusion and phase transformation because of the number of different elements that is demanded in the process. The most notable product from this effect is an increased creep resistance. Lastly we have the cocktail effect, which is identical to the smoothie analogy mentioned previously, in that the resultant characteristics is a combination of both the elements and their interaction. This is possible the most promising concept behind high-entropy alloys, which fuels researchers with ambition to discover highly optimized materials by meticulously combining and predicting properties from different elements. Examples of this can be the refractory HEA's developed by "Air Force Research Laboratory" severely exceeding the melting points and strength of previous Ni or Co-based superalloys by alloying specifically refractory elements such as Mo. Nb and W. Another example is the research conducted by Zhang et al. on the high-entropy system \ch{FeCoNi(AlSi_x)} with ($0 < x 0.8$). In this HEA it was found that increased amount of either Al or Si lowered the saturation magnetization of the alloy. By tuning the relative amounts, it was found excellent properties for an $x=0.2$ HEA in terms of the magnetization, electrical resistivity and yield strength to produce a promising soft-magnet. The same was also found in \ch{Al_{0-2}CoCrFeNi} where the larger addition of Ni reduced the ferromagnetism of the alloy and in \ch{CoCrCuFeNiTi_x} alloys where $x = 0$ was paramagnetic and $x > 0.8$ showed superparamagnetic properties. In general we find that that the saturation magnetism is mostly dependent on the contents and distribution of ferromagnetic elements such as Fe, Co and Ni while the addition of anti-ferromagnets like Cr could be difficult to predict. For example addition of Cr to FeCoNi, the ferromagnetic compound becomes paramagnetic. 

For example in the ferromagnetic HEA CoFeMnNiX, X = Al, Cr, Ga, Sn, studied in \cite{ZUO201710}, Mn pushed the material to the ferromagnetic phase, meanwhile addition of Cr pushed the material to a paramagnetic phase. Likewise in the equimolar system of \ch{CrMnFeCoNi} \cite{PhysRevB.96.014437}, the local magnetic moment of Cr was found to align antiferromagnetic, and the ferromagnetic character was attributed to local magnetic moments of Fe and Mn.
