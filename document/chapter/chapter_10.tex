\chapter{Future work}

In future work we would like to continue the progress made in this project on semiconducting high-entropy silicides and put more empasis on a qualitative study that dissolves the uncertainites revolving the results of this project. This would include a more thorough investigation of magnetic and geometric consideration to the \ch{(CrFeMnNi)Si2} alloy to locate the optimal ground-state. Following an in-depth analysis of the band gap, with special considerations to successfully implementing band gap specific functionals such as HSE06 and MBJ. Furthermore, a possible future project would be to investigate to greater extent the quasi-ternary phase diagram discussed in section 8.1. Lastly, out of own interest a project combining the fields of machine-learning and DFT would be very interesting, possibly a study where we use machine learning to predict the outcomes of different functionals on accuratly calculate the band gap of semiconductors.
