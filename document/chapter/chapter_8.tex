\label{sec:Eg}

\section{Compare and anlayze band gaps}
\textbf{Results here can be a table of the band gaps for different SQS both within one cell, or compare multiple cells. Other results include Density of States, Local DOS, bandgap from eigenval without impurity states. Compare different methods, GGA, SCAN and hybrid. The CHGCAR to evaluate bonding in terms of metallic or covalent. Possibly band-unfolding? }
