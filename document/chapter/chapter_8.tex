\chapter{Alternative compositions}
\label{sec:comps}

Up until this point we have looked in detail at the high-entropy silicide \ch{(CrFeMnNi)Si2}. In this chapter we will broaden our search of compositions based on the $\beta$-\ch{FeSi2} structure. First, we will look at various compositions inside the quaternary phase diagram of Cr, Fe, Mn and Ni, then consider some compositions where chromium, manganese or nickel are replaced by cobalt or titanium. 

\section{Exploring the quaternary phase diagram of Cr, Fe, Mn and Ni.}
In this section, we aim to expand our search of this diagram by generating SQSs of the 48 atom model slightly away from equimolar distribution of 3d elements. The list of compositions are listed in table 8.1, with corresponding total energy, magnetic moment and formation energy in the familiar format. Ideally each composition would differ only by one element to provide a clear view of each direction in the phase diagram, but the TDEP implementation insisted in also reducing Nickel to stay consistent with the 48 atom supercell.

\end{table}


In table 8.1 we observe that moving away from the equimolar system result in both less and more stable alloys. Clearly the lowest formation energies (most stable) correspond to compositions rich in manganese and poor in chromium. Likewise the least stable compositions in table 8.1 contain either increased amounts of Cr or reduced amounts of Mn compared to the equimolar system. In the equimolar composition the magnetic moment was attributed to primarily Cr and Mn atoms in the lattice. In table 8.1 we observe similarly that compositions rich in Cr and Mn exhibits the largest magnetic moments and vice versa. The band gaps of the respective compositions in five unique SQSs can be seen in table 8.2 below, calculated with PBE GGA.

\end{table}

From table 8.2 we observe that most compositions are half-metals like the equimolar system with a spin up polarization. Each composition shows large variation between configurations. We note $E_\text{G, max} ^\text{up} \approx 0.5$ eV and $E_\text{min} ^\text{up} \approx 0.1$ eV in both \ch{Cr3Fe3Mn7Ni3Si32} and \ch{Cr5Fe3Mn5Ni3Si32}, and further $E_\text{G, max} ^\text{up} \approx 0.4$ eV and $E_\text{min} ^\text{up} \approx 0.1$ eV in \ch{Cr3FeMn5Ni3Si32}. In all three of these compositions the proportion of manganese is increased relative to the equimolar system, and two out of the three compositions contain reduced amounts of chromium. Looking at the two compositions with the least indication of a band gap \ch{Cr5Fe5Mn3Ni3Si32} and \ch{Cr3Fe3Mn3Ni7}, these contain reduced amounts of manganese. Thus, based on the few compositions tested in this experiment we can state a relation of the band gap mainly to manganese, but also chromium.     

Based on the most stable configuration of each composition, we observe very encouraging results in the \ch{Cr3Fe3Mn7Ni3Si32} composition with the largest $E_G ^\text{up}$ of the set of configurations. Likewise the most stable SQS of the \ch{Cr3Fe5Mn5Ni3Si32} composition is a semiconductor with a total band gap of about 0.1 eV. In the composition \ch{Cr5Fe5Mn3Ni3Si32}, the most stable SQS predicts a defect or impurity band gap as we discussed previously where the eigenvalues return a finite band gap despite of defect states. However we have not been able to investigate the nature and effect of this impurity band gap to further extent, likewise for the similar impurity gaps listed in table 8.2 and the 0 band gaps in spin down. Below in figures 8.1 and 8.2 we include the projected density of states around $E_F$ of the most stable SQS of each composition. Because we only include and discuss the most stable SQS, the features of these figures can be subject to the uniqueness of that particular SQS rather than a distinct feature of the exact composition, however as stated previously the most stable configuration provides the most likely properties of the composition within the scope of this project.

The PDOSs are in good agreement with the listed values in table 7.2. Both \ch{Cr3Fe3Mn7Ni3Si32}  and \ch{Cr5Fe3Mn5Ni3Si32} display sizable band gaps in spin up, while figure 8.1 d point to a total band gap around 0.1 eV for SQS D of \ch{Cr3Fe5Mn5Ni3Si32}. On the other hand, we observe as for the 192-atom SQS a dissimilarity between the density of states band gap in \ch{Cr5Fe5Mn3Ni3Si32} SQS C (figure 8.1 b) and the eigenvalue defect band gap listed in table 7.2. This can be better understood by figure A.3 in appendix A.1, that clearly show small finite values at $E_F$ in spin up. This DOS may resemble that of a doped material.    


In figure 7.7 we observed that manganese distinctly occupied states in the spin down channel around $E_F$ and was a key contributor as to why the spin down channel of \ch{(CrFeMnNi)Si2} was metallic in the most stable SQS. This is also largely the case in the compositions shown above in figure 8.1 and 8.2, and is particularly evident in figure 8.1 where Mn dominates the spin down states around $E_F$ in the \ch{Cr3Fe3Mn7Ni3Si32} composition. By reducing the number of Mn we still find that the Mn states prohibit the band gap in spin down, as seen in figure 8.1 b. In the chromium rich compositions plotted in figures 8.1 b and c, we observe that also Cr states prohibit the spin down band gap, and dominate states near $E_F$ in spin up as well. Contrary, in the \ch{Cr3Fe3Mn3Ni7Si32} composition plotted in figure 8.2, we do not observe any distinct peaks of elements, but rather consistent small finite DOS around $E_F$ in all elements.  The sole composition with clear evidence of a spin down gap is from the chromium poor system plotted in figure 8.1 d. Also in this structure we see that the effects of Mn around $E_F$ is dominant in spin down from the relative large amounts of Mn, but in comparison to the other composition these states are pushed away from the Fermi energy.

\end{figure}

An important factor of these results is that because each composition alters simultaneous elements, interpreting and relating the results to a particular alteration is challenging. For example, is the result of the \ch{Cr5Fe3Mn5Ni3Si32} permutation a consequence of less Fe or increments to both Cr and Mn? Furthermore, is the large band gap in spin up of \ch{Cr3Fe3Mn7Ni3Si32} a product of increasing manganese or reducing the other elements? From the comparatively large gaps in spin up of \ch{Cr3Fe3Mn7Ni3Si32} and \ch{Cr3Fe5Mn5Ni3Si32}, in combination with a larger presence of Cr states in spin up in the Cr rich permutations, we here ascribe the large band gaps to a reduction of chromium, more so than other effects. However, we observe from both \ch{Cr5Fe5Mn4Ni3Si32} and \ch{Cr3Fe3Mn3Ni7Si32} (figure 8.2) in addition to the manganese rich composition, that Mn plays a vital role on the band gap of these structures. It's clear that the \ch{Cr3Fe5Mn5Ni3Si32} alloy manages to strike a balance between 3d elements that results in a specific interplay and correspondingly very promising properties. It could have been instructive to look at for example the pair distribution functions and compare to the equimolar system, but from the factors discussed in section 7.2.4, we leave this to future work. 

As stated previously, we have relied on the PBE GGA functional to determine the band gap, from its reliability and favorable computation cost. Nevertheless, we have conducted calculations with SCAN and HSE06 on some of the more promising structures. For instance, in SQS D of the \ch{Cr3Fe5Mn5Ni3Si32} alloy, we get lower values in both spin up and down with SCAN, specifically $E_\text{G, SCAN} ^\text{up}= 0.21$ eV and $E_\text{G, SCAN} ^\text{dw} = 0.08$ eV. With the HSE06 functional we get $E_\text{G, HSE06} ^\text{up} = 0.53$ eV and $E_\text{G, HSE06} ^\text{dw} = 0$ eV. In SQS B of the \ch{Cr3Fe3Mn7Ni3Si32} alloy, the PBE functional resulted in band gaps equal to $E_\text{G, PBE} ^\text{up} = 0.47$ eV and $E_\text{G, PBE} ^\text{dw} = 0$ eV. Contrary, SCAN yields a small band gap in spin down of about 0.002 eV, and a 0 gap in spin up of this structure. Similarly, the HSE06 band gaps of this structure are $E_\text{G, HSE06} ^\text{up} = 0.08$ eV and $E_\text{G, HSE06} ^\text{dw} = 0.11$ eV. Moreover, this is a defect band gap, with $E_\text{G, HSE06} ^\text{up, eigen}(0.01) = 0.18$ eV and $E_\text{G, HSE06} ^\text{dw, eigen}(0.01) = 0.16$ eV. The density of states of the HSE06 band gaps discussed above are displayed in figure 8.3. As we have experienced previously, in the case of the defect band gap; $E_G ^\text{eigen} \neq E_G ^\text{dos}$.

\section{High-entropy silicides with cobalt/titanium}

The compositions in this section are deliberate combinations, intended to both investigate the role of individual elements in the \ch{(CrFeMnNi)Si2} system, and broaden our search of potential high-entropy silicides based on $\beta$-\ch{FeSi2}. In these alloys we replace Cr, Mn or Ni, with Co or Ti. Note that the alloys contains a total of 48 atoms as before, with equimolar distribution of 3d elements. In similar fashion to the preceding section, we begin by presenting in table 8.3, the mean and standard deviation of the total energy and magnetic moment of 5 distinct SQSs of each alloy

\caption{Total energy (Toten), magnetic moment (Mag) and formation energy ($E_\text{FPA}$) of alloys based on combinations of Cr, Fe, Mn, Ni, Co, Ti and Si.}
\end{table}

In terms of the formation energy, we observe that cobalt evidently yield the most stable alloys, with \ch{(CoFeMnNi)Si2} at the top and and \ch{(CrFeCoNi)Si2} at the bottom. On the other side, both \ch{(CrFeTiNi)Si2} and \ch{(CrFeMnTi)Si2} where we introduce titanium in place of manganese and nickel respectively, results in the overall least stable compositions. A precise physical interpretation of the stability between compositions is challenging from the shallow analysis in this project, but we note that the two most stable alloys consists of the most chemically similar elements, with respect to properties such as electronegativity and atomic size. Accordingly, the least stable alloys are comprised of the most chemically dissimilar elements. This is in good agreement with the discussion in section 2.2, regarding phase formation of high-entropy alloys. Additionally, in the compositions discussed in the previous section, we observed that the most stable composition was \ch{Cr3Fe5Mn5Ni3Si32}, where the Cr proportion was reduced. In conjunction with the results of the titanium alloys above, we may suspect that smaller elements are ill-suited in these alloys constructed from the \ch{FeSi2} structure.   

In line with the other compositions studied in this project, the magnetization is clearly related to chromium and manganese also in this case. This is seen by the overall lowest magnetic moments in the two compositions without these elements, and reversely the highest magnetic moments are associated to compositions comprised of both chromium and manganese. Comparing the magnetic moments of \ch{(CrFeCoNi)Si2} and \ch{(CoFeMnNi)Si2}, it appears that chromium is most responsible for the magnetism of these alloys. Furthermore, we observe that substituting Ni with either Ti and Co yields increased magnetic moments. As we have discussed previously, the uniqueness of each SQS makes it difficult to draw conclusion on various properties. In table 8.4 below, we list the magnetic moments of the most stable SQS of each alloy. Contrary to the mean value of the set of configurations, the most stable supercell of \ch{(CrFeCoNi)Si2}, like the \ch{(CoFeMnNi)Si2} alloy is nonmagnetic. Moreover, the \ch{(CrFeMnTi)Si2} composition is less magnetic relative to both \ch{(CrFeMnCo)Si2} and \ch{(CrFeMnNi)Si2}, as opposed to the mean values.

\caption{Magnetic moment of the most stable SQS of alloys comprised of combinations of Cr, Fe, Mn, Ni, Co, Ti and Si.}
\end{table}

Thus, based on the most stable configurations of each composition, we can state that replacing either Cr or Mn (with Co), removes the magnetic moment of the alloy. Furthermore we find that the magnetic moment is reduced when Ni is substituted with Ti, and increased by Co. However, while substituting manganese with Co yields a nonmagnetic alloy, Ti for Mn only slightly reduces the magnetic moment. 

In regards to the band gaps of these alloys, the majority are metals with the exception of the \ch{(CrFeMnCo)Si2} alloy. Here, we locate a band gap in the spin up direction slightly below 0.5 eV. In addition, the \ch{(CrFeTiNi)Si2} also exhibits a small band gap in the spin up direction. As have been the case throughout this project, we learn that the metallic structures are caused by defect states at the band edges. By removing said defect states analogous to what we have done previously, we can find total band gaps of around 0.05 eV in the most stable supercell in each of five alloys. Furthermore, both of the spin up band gaps found for the \ch{(CrFeTiNi)Si2} alloy and \ch{(CrFeMnCo)Si2}, are enlarged from neglecting defect states, deeming these as defect band gaps equal to what we have experienced in other instances. Following the discussion above on the magnetic moments of the different compositions, we note the largest spin polarization of the hypothetical band gaps in the \ch{(CrFeMnCo)Si2} and \ch{(CrFeTiNi)Si2} alloys. On the other hand, the remaining three compositions exhibits identical hypothetical band gaps in both spin directions. The results discussed above can be seen in table 8.5. The projected density of states of the half-metallic supercell of the \ch{(CrFeMnCo)Si2} alloy is displayed in figure 8.4.

As was generally the case for the Cr-Fe-Mn-Ni-Si alloys, this structure displays a dominant number of manganese states in spin down at energies just above $E_F$, and a large number of Cr states right below $E_F$ in spin up. Analog to the most stable supercell of the \ch{Cr5Fe5Mn3Ni3Si32} alloy discussed in section 8.1, the presence of defect states in the spin up band gap of \ch{CrFeMnCoSi2}, results in small finite DOS at the Fermi energy, and the band gap calculated from the eigenvalues is shifted above $E_F$, resembling that of a doped material. The PDOSs of the other four alloys are displayed in figure 8.5. In agreement with the values listed in table 8.5, we observe from the PDOS that these are metallic compounds with finite DOS at $E_F$ in both spins.

Above we have evaluated the band gaps of the different compositions based solely on the most stable supercells. In \ch{(CrFeCoNi)Si2}, \ch{(CrFeTiNi)Si2}, \ch{(CrFeMnTi)Si2} and \ch{(CrFeMnCo)Si2}, we find similar properties across all five configurations.  On the other side, in the metallic alloy \ch{(CoFeMnNi)Si2}, we discover very narrow total band gaps in two lesser stable configurations (SQS A and E) of 0.03 eV and 0.006 eV respectively. The density of states of these structures are displayed in figure 8.6.

\section{Negative systems}

In the above sections we have observed that aside from the \ch{(CrFeMnNi)Si2} alloy, we have had limited success in locating semiconducting alloys when moving away from the \ch{(CrFeMnNi)Si2} alloy, and particularly from the Cr-Fe-Mn-Ni-Si system. In addition to the alloys disused above, we have carried out similar simulations on other alloys not included in this report. In most of these alloys we experienced limited or no success with respect to the band gap. All five SQSs of a \ch{(ScVMnZn)Si2} alloy based on \ch{FeSi2} turned out metallic. In \ch{(VMnFeCu)Si2}, we found one supercell with a defect band gap of 0.007 eV. Furthermore, we tested various four-element compositions such as \ch{Cr6Co6Ni4Si32}, \ch{Cr6Fe6Co4Si32}, \ch{Cr6Fe6Ni4Si32} and \ch{Fe6Co6Ni4Si32}. Out of these four compositions and corresponding 20 total SQSs, noteworthy we found a defect band gap of 0.15 eV in the spin up direction in one supercell of \ch{Cr6Fe6Co4Si32}, and a spin up band gap of 0.27 eV in \ch{Cr6Fe6Ni4Si32}. In the latter, we observed smaller single spin band gaps in additional configurations as well. The other two compositions were metallic across all tested supercells.    

In this project, we have based our alloys on the Semiconductor $\beta$-\ch{FeSi2}. However, we started this project by examining high-entropy silicides based on trigonal \ch{Fe2Si}. Here, we constructed similarly five distinct supercells of \ch{(CrFeCoNi)2Si} and \ch{(CrFeMnNi)2Si}. The supercells consisted of a total of 54 atoms, with 18 silicon atoms and the remaining 32 sites distributed equimolarly between 3d elements. Furthermore, we have performed simulations of the \ch{(CrFeMnNi)Si2} composition in 72-atom SQSs of hexagonal \ch{CrSi2}, and 44-atom SQSs of tetragonal and orthorombic \ch{Mn4Si7} as well. First and foremost, these systems were much more computationally demanding than the \ch{FeSi2} based alloys, thus not all five supercells of these systems succeeded. Of the structures successfully relaxed and electronically converged, we found predominantly metallic structures.
