\textbf{Thermoelectricity and renewable energy introduction}

High-entropy alloys are a novel class of materials based on multiple component alloying, as opposed to the more traditional binary alloys. This results in an unprecedented opportunity for discovery of new materials with a superior degree of tuning for specific properties and applications. Recent research on high-entropy alloys have resulted in materials with exceedingly strong mechanical properties such as strength, corrosion and temperature resistance, etc \textbf{find references}. Meanwhile, the functional properties of high-entropy alloys are less elaborated. In this project, we explore the possibility of efficient thermoelectric materials from the imagined low thermal conductivity of HEAs due to the disordered structure, provided that we find HEAs with other suitable properties, most notably a small band gap \textbf{cite}. Thus, in order to locate semiconducting alloy we will have to move away from traditional high-entropy metallic alloys and instead look at high-entropy silicides. This is done for two reasons, firstly silicon and various transition metal-silicides are environmentally sound and silicon in particular is heavily applied in micro-electronic devices and renewable energy sources such as solar power, thus silicon based alloys could readily be implemented into these technologies. Secondly, transition metal silicides offer a range of initial compounds with band gaps ranging from 0.1 - 2 eV to base our high-entropy silicides on that match the band gap requirements of good thermoelectrics. This project is motivated particularly from the work of Gild. et al \cite{GILD2019337}, whom in 2019 successfully synthesized a first of its kind single-phase high-entropy disilicide \ch{(MoNbTaW)Si2}. This silicide adopted the non-cubic hexagonal C40 crystal structure and displayed reduced thermal conductivity compared to conventional disilicides in the equivalent crystal structure. Non-cubic structure was emphasized above due to the fact that most high-entropy alloys tend to adopt simple cubic structures. An other study that found phases of non-cubic high-entropy silicides is the master thesis of Rosviik (2021), that syntesized single-phases of high-entropy silicides based Si Co Cr Fe Ni in both hexagonal and orthorhombic crystal structures. In this project we will investigate candidate high-entropy disilicides based on $\beta$-\ch{FeSi2} semiconductor, where the iron sites are populated by near/exact equimolar distribution of various transition metals such as Cr, Fe, Mn, Ni, Co and Ti.  


A key motivation of this thesis is the ability to perform such a broad study of complex materials in light of the advances in material informatics and computational methods. In this project, we will perform a ab initio study backed by density functional theory. In the addition to the development in computational power, is also the progress of modeling materials, specifically we will apply a method called Special Quasi-random Structures (SQS) to model the disordered structure of  high-entropy alloys.
 
 
Given a background in high-entropy alloys, one could ask if this study is truly sensible. In the later sections we will cover the details of this field, and it quickly become clear that the materials investigated in this study does not fall under the precise definition of high-entropy alloys, nor do we intend to explore the properties and factors relating to high-entropy stabilized alloys such as the configurational entropy, phase stability and finite temperature studies. However this study is motivated from the discovery of these materials and promising properties, and venture into a more hypothetical space of materials, enabled by the computational methods available to study the potential properties of such materials. On the other hand, very recent studies \textbf{Mari, and other HEA silicide study} have experimentally synthesized high-entropy disilicides, thus in some way justifying the direction of this project. 

We begin this project by reviewing key concepts of solid-state physics for readers lacking a background in materials science, and an introduction to the base 3d silicides of the experimental work. Later follows a theoretic walk-through of the relevant concepts of this thesis, these topics include high-entropy alloys, special quasi-random structures, and density functional theory. Next we shine light on the implementation of DFT in this project, and other computational details required to reproduce the results in this thesis, such as the use of the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP) and implementation of SQS. Finally we present the results of our study, these include the band gap and electronic properties of various structures and the success and challenges of the computational methods applied throughout the study.
