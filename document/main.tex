I would like to express my gratitude towards my supervisor Ole Martin Løvvik. For always being available and prioritize my work from the first day to the last. Coming into this project, I had no prior knowledge of density functional theory or quantum mechanical modeling. So, for your guidance in this project I am truly thankful, and know that this project would have been impossible without you. I also feel as if I have made a friend and someone I could talk through throughout this project. Due to the oddity of these recent years with the covid-19 outbreak and self-isolation this have been very important to my sanity and mental health combined with the difficulty involved in writing a master theses. On this same note, I would like to thank all my friends and family members that have been there and believed in me, and always reminding me to stay positive.

\chapter{Introduction}                  %% ... or Bakgrunn

A major concern in the energy sector is the loss of energy as waste heat. An example of this is seen in for instance \cite{thermo}, where they estimated that about 60 percent of the energy produced in USA in 2012 was lost as waste heat. Contrary to most energy sources that suffer from this problem of losing energy to heat, thermoelectrcity can generate electricity from heat by what's known as the Seebeck effect \cite{wikipedia_thermoelectric_2020}. Thus, thermoelecticity have many promising applications, for example one could imagine a conjunction between thermoelectric generators and mechanical generators to recover a portion of the waste heat produced by the latter. However, currently thermoelectricity is of limited practical use due to a lack of efficient thermoelectric materials.  This can be explained from the thermoelectric figure of merit, composed by the Seebeck Coefficient $S$, electrical conductivity $\sigma$, temperature $T$ and the thermal conductivity, in the following relation \cite{bandgap2Dirac} 

\begin{equation}
zT = \frac{S^2\sigma T}{\kappa}. 
\end{equation}

Thus, an efficient thermoelectric material consist of three dependent factors: A high Seebeck coefficient, high electrical conductivity, and low thermal conductivity. A popular strategy to achieve this relation is the phonon-glass electron crystal approach \cite{SnyderG.Jeffrey2008Ctm}, in which one will introduce complexity and anharmonicity to the crystal lattice by some means to increase levels of phonon scattering, without also increasing the scattering of electrons. Furthermore good thermoelectrics are narrow gap semiconductors, as explained in \cite{TE_gap}, that found the highest zT values for semiconductors with a band gap between 6-10 $k_B$T, which at room temperature equals around 0.2 eV.   

In this project we will look at high-entropy alloys as potential thermoelectric materials. High-entropy alloys are a novel material class that extends the concept of traditional binary-alloys such as steel, to multi-component alloys. The name "high-entropy" stems from the fact that mixing a larger number of elements increase the configurational entropy of the solution, that contribute to stabilize the materials. These materials are in particular known for their strong mechanical properties \cite{hea}, for instance high strength at elevated temperatures. Furthermore evidence of low thermal conductivity originating from a disordered crystal structure. Hence, provided that we can find narrow gap high-entropy alloys, these could be relevant and promising high zT thermoelectric materials.  

Specifically, in this project we will look at high-entropy silicides. These are a lesser studied subclass of high-entropy alloys. The first experimentally synthesized high-entropy silicide was found in 2019 by Gild. et al \cite{GILD2019337}. He found a first of its kind single-phase high-entropy disilicide \ch{(MoNbTaW)Si2}. This silicide adopted the hexagonal C40 crystal structure, and displayed low thermal conductivity compared to conventional disilicides in the equivalent crystal structure. Additionally, very recently a master thesis student at the University of Oslo managed to synthesize three phases of non-cubic high-entropy silicides based on Si, Co, Cr, Fe, and Ni in both hexagonal and orthorhombic symmetries \cite{mari}.  We base this project on silicides because firstly silicon and various transition metal-silicides are environmentally sound and silicon in particular is heavily applied in micro-electronic devices and renewable energy sources such as solar power, thus silicon based alloys could readily be implemented into these technologies. Secondly, transition metal silicides offer a good range of initial compounds with suitable band gaps for thermoelectrics \cite{silicde}.   

This project is performed by ab initio methods in the framework of density functional theory. The disordered structure of high-entropy alloys are handled with a numerical method called special quasi-random structures. The particular materials investigated in this project will be based on the semiconductor $\beta$-\ch{FeSi2}. We will mainly investigate the band gap of such alloys, for this we employ three classes of functionals in DFT: GGA, meta-GGA and hybrid functionals. To study different possible alloys, we construct five distinct supercells of the master compound for each composition, where the iron sites are populated by a quasi-random distribution between 3d transition metals. Special emphasis will fall on alloys consisting of Cr, Fe, Mn, and Ni. 

We begin this project by reviewing the fundamentals and properties of high-entropy alloys, thereafter we present a theoretical description of the computational methods in this project, SQS, and DFT. Next we discuss various practical aspects of DFT such as the exchange-correlation functionals and numerical convergence, in addition to numerical settings necessary to reproduce the results in this project. Finally we present and discuss the results, which begin with the high-entropy silicide \ch{(CrFeMnNi)Si2}, followed by various derivatives and alternatives to this system.  In the end we give a brief conclusion of our work and discuss possible directions for future research.

\chapter{Conclusion}

High-entropy alloys has emerged as a rapidly growing interest in materials science from the large range of possibilities and flexibility. In this project we have set out to study the possibility of a narrow gap semiconducting high-entropy silicide with top of the line computational power and methods, in the prospect of discovering next-generation efficient thermoelectric materials. The materials in mind were based on the \ch{FeSi2} semiconductor, and modeled with the SQS method in the framework of DFT. To study the potential semiconductors we generated five distinct configurations of each composition and investigated the band gap, mainly with PBE GGA.  

Our most successful effort was based around a 48-atom model of chromium, iron, manganese, and nickel in the Cr:Fe:Mn:Ni:Si system. In the equimolar composition \ch{(CrFeMnNi)Si2}, we observed large variation of the band gap between the five distinct configurations. In spin up, the band gap ranged from 0.08 - 0.34 eV. The most stable supercell was a half-metal, while the other four supercells displayed small spin down gaps between 0.03 eV and 0.05 eV as well. Calculations with SCAN and HSE06 produced unpredictable outputs that varied greatly between SQSs, and contained a larger degree of uncertainty compared to PBE. However, with HSE06 we found spin up band gaps of 0.55 eV and 0.71 eV in two respective supercells, and a total band gap of 0.18 eV in another. Contrary, the SCAN functional resulted in total band gaps around 0.1 in three SQSs, one metallic supercell and one half-metallic structure with a spin down band gap of 0.1 eV.   

Following the equimolar composition, we conducted a brief exploration of the quasi-ternary phase diagram of this composition. Contrary to the equimolar system we found here more frequently half-metals. By analyzing the projected density of states we were able to relate the metallic spin down channel to a dominant presence of manganese states around the Fermi energy.  Inside the compositions that we tested, we found evidence for that there exists a positive relation between the band gap in this system, most notably in spin up, and compositions poor in chromium and/or rich in manganese. Specifically, we found two very positive compositions: \ch{Cr3Fe3Mn7Ni3Si32} and \ch{Cr3Fe5Mn5Ni3Si32}, where the most stable supercell of the former displayed a spin up band gap of 0.47 eV, and the latter a total band gap of 0.1 eV, with PBE.

Lastly, we tested various compositions where we introduced cobalt/titanium at the cost of either Cr, Mn or Ni. Based on the most stable configuration in each of these compositions, the only band gap we found in this experiment was a spin up band gap of 0.46 eV in \ch{(CrFeMnCo)Si2}. By manually investigating the calculated eigenvalues of the different compositions, we were able to relate the metallic compounds to defect states in the band gap. This is a familiar term in random alloys, in which states at the band edges deviate slightly from completely full/empty occupancy. The effect and occurrence of defect states varied from composition to composition and supercell to supercell, for instance in the Cr:Fe:Mn:Ni:Si system, defects states was most prominent for spin down states, which resulted in several half-metallic structures. 

In accordance with the spin polarization of the band gap, we noted a finite magnetic moment in most alloys.  Distinctly, the equimolar alloy contained a magnetic moment of $0.083 \mu_B$ in all five configurations of the equimolar alloy. Upon investigation of the local magnetic moments, we discovered that the magnetism was mainly attributed to chromium and manganese atoms in the lattice. This was found as a general trend for all alloys based on the \ch{FeSi2} structure. Due to this severe spin polarization, a possible application of these alloys, particularly the Cr:Fe:Mn:Ni:Si alloys, could be  could be as spintronics \cite{spintronic}. 

In terms of thermoelectric application, we find limited success in respect to the band gap. Recalling that good thermoelectrics are semiconductors with band gaps around 0.2 eV, we observe that the semiconducting band gaps of the \ch{(CrFeMnNi)Si2} are too small. However, we have found instances more suitable, such as the HSE06 band gap of 0.18 eV in one of the supercells. Furthermore, we can expect that the band gaps in the real material are larger than the PBE band gaps, thus there is a possibility that the \ch{(CrFeMnNi)Si2} alloy could be applied as a thermoelectric. Nevertheless, to qualitatively state the thermoelectric applicability of this compound, we would have to study properties such as the Seebeck coefficient, as well the thermal and electrical conductivity.

\chapter{Future work}

In future studies on this system, I would first and foremost try to resolve several of the uncertainties circling the results presented in this project. This would include a more thoughtful investigation of the true ground state of the \ch{(CrFeMnNi)Si2} composition, by first testing multiple configurations and a larger number of SQS sizes to reduce variance and obtain a converged value of the band gap. Secondly, to decide on the most representative configuration we should have put more efforts into correctly/optimally specify the magnetic configuration of each SQS, and study excited states of the alloys to account for entropic contributions to the stability.  Moreover, a test of different crystal structures in addition to the orthorombic CMCE space group of the \ch{(CrFeMnNi)Si2} alloy should be done, as the local minima method of DFT does not guarantee that this is the most stable conformation of the alloy.

The overarching motivation of this thesis have been to simply locate a band gap in high-entropy silicides, which by no means have been simple. However, now that we have located such a compound, in future work we would like to devote more effort into specifically analyze the band gap. Potentially try to plot and analyze the band structure of the alloy and qualitatively study the band gap by different functionals. Furthermore, we performed only a very limited search of the quasi-ternary phase diagram of the Cr:Fe:Mn:Ni:Si system, but found promising results in the direction of less chromium and more in manganese. Thus, a future study of more deliberate compositions in these directions would also be interesting. Provided that these results yielded positive outcomes of the band gap, suitable for thermoelectric application, future work could focus on a complete study of this material as a thermoelectric, and consider factors such as the Seebeck coefficient and electrical and thermal conductivity.
